# Reptiloid Go - Simple Replicate API Client for Go
For the Russian version of this README, see the [README üá∑üá∫](README-ru.md).

A friendly Go library for generating AI images using Replicate's models. No complex setup, just simple and clean code.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or later
- A [Replicate](https://replicate.com) account and API token

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/rmay1er/reptiloid-go
```

### Get Your API Token

1. Sign up at [Replicate](https://replicate.com)
2. Go to your [API tokens page](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)
3. Copy your API token

### Your First AI Image

Create a `.env` file in your project:

```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Create `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/joho/godotenv"
    "github.com/rmay1er/reptiloid-go/reptiloid"
    "github.com/rmay1er/reptiloid-go/reptiloid/models/image" //For image models
    "github.com/rmay1er/reptiloid-go/reptiloid/models/text" //For text models
)

func main() {
    // Load environment variables
    godotenv.Load()

    // Get your API token
    apiKey := os.Getenv("REPLICATE_API_TOKEN")

    // Choose a model (FluxSchnell for fast generation)
    model := image.FluxSchnell

    // Create the client
    client := replicate.NewClient(model, apiKey)

    // Describe your image
    input := models.FluxSchnellInput{
        Prompt:      "A cute robot playing guitar in the park",
    }

    // Generate the image!
    result, err := client.GenerateImage(input)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Oops! Something went wrong: %v\n", err)
        return
    }

    // Your image is ready!
    fmt.Printf("Image generated: %s\n", result.Output[0])
}
```

Run it:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Where's my image?
The library returns a URL where your image is stored. You can download it or share it directly.

### How much does it cost?
Check [Replicate's pricing](https://replicate.com/pricing). Most images cost a few cents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Models

Want to use a different Replicate model? Just add it to the models package!

```go
// In internal/replicate/models/models.go
var MyNewModel = replicate.NewReplicateModel[MyInput]("username/model-name")
```

### Running Tests

```bash
go test ./...
```
